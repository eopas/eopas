Language Code Tables

*Source:* http://www.ethnologue.com/codes/

*Termsof use:*

    In the interest of fostering the use of ISO 639-3 for the uniform
    identification of all the world's languages in information systems,
    SIL International releases certain information from the Ethnologue
    database for use in the development of information systems,
    specifically, information that describes language identifiers in terms
    of alternate names and countries where spoken. You are welcome to
    download the information as provided and incorporate the supplied
    tables into your own database application. You are also authorized
    to make that application available to the public, provided that you:

    - cite SIL International and this web site (www.ethnologue.com) as the
        source of the information,
    - do not modify or extend the codes other than those set aside for local
        use (i.e. qaa to qtz), and
    - use only the data in the tables and no other data posted on this site.
        Rather, other information on this site should be accessed by supply-
        ing a link like the following (where abc is an ISO 639-3 code):

            http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=abc

    SIL International periodically updates the supplied information, and
    intends http://www.ethnologue.com/codes/ to be the sole distribution
    source in order to ensure uniformity of versions. You are not authorized
    to redistribute the downloadable code tables, whether in the exact form
    they were obtained from this site or in a modified form you have
    developed, without the written consent of SIL International.

* CountryCodes.tab - The complete list of three-letter language identifiers used in the current Ethnologue (along with name, primary country, and language status).
